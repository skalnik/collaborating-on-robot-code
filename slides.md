## What is GitHub?

* A definitive place for your robot code
* Keeps snapshots of your code
* Helps with collaboration on your code
* Can keep track of bugs/feature requests

^ This means you don't need to email files around, or lose a USB drive
Can make a bug report and assign it to a team mate
When you find a bug, you can go through your history to find where it was introduced

---

# Ok, neat!
## But, how do I use it?

# Teams
